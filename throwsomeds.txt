Get money
New money
It's what you been waiting on

Rich Boy sellin' crack fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight no slack just bought a Cadillac
Took it to the chop shop
Got the damn top dropped two colored flip flopped
Candy red lollipop
There's hoes in the parking lot
But I still got my glock hot
New money motherfucker don't you see the big knot
Don't you see the big chain
Don't you see the big rims
Wonder who they hatin' on lately
Baby it's him candy paint,
Gator skin seats call me Dun Dee
Up in your hood I'm the one that you wanna be
Haters wish they could feel the wood in my '83
Ridin' with no tint so the motherfuckers know it's me

Rich Boy sellin' crack
Fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight no slack
Just bought a Cadillac (THROW SOME D'S ON THAT BITCH!)
Just bought a Cadillac (THROW SOME D'S ON THAT BITCH!)
Just bought a Cadillac

I never slip, I never fall,
A lot of hoes give me they numbers but I never call
A real O.G. look at V.I.P. and see a nigga ball
Then after we hit the club baby then I'm gonna hit them draws
I'm gonna break you off (and that's all)
Every freak should have a picture of my dick (on they wall)
Polow be the shit, zone 4 be the click
Yeah this for my dawgs
Yeah gangsters, hustlers, wanksters, busters
(Wait a minute motherfucker)

Hit the block on some new ten thousand dollar wheels
Kinda strange how I feel,
Toucha gator on my wheel
Got peanut butter ice cream
Petter pan seats just gotta
Fresh cut
Now we looking for them freaks
Take her back yella bitch
Make her drop them draws
Imma show you how to ball
Middle finger to the law so fuck them
Niggas tell em' what they wanna do?
Hating on a player 'cause my 'lac skated 22's.
When I pull up imma park right at the front door lean
In my cup got purp in my blunt.
Imma real pimp bitch I ain't playin' like a trick
Just bought a new 'Lac bout to put them
Thangs on that bitch!!!!!
